    # Introduction to the slope of a line - II

    Now that you are familiar with the concept of slope, let us try a tough
    one. Your answer has to be correct within $0.5$ of the actual answer.

    **Note: ** Click "Submit answer for feedback"(without answering question at first) to see the figure referenced above.
