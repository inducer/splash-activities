    # Introduction to the slope of a line - I

    Using the graph paper sketches below calculate the slope. The length of the
    orange line represents $\bigtriangleup x$ and the length of the green line
    represents $\bigtriangleup y$. Slope is given by $\frac{$\bigtriangleup
    y$}{\bigtrianlgeup x}$.
