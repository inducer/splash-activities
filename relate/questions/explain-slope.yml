    # Introduction to the slope of a line - I

    Using the graph paper sketches below calculate the slope. The length of the
    orange line represents $\bigtriangleup x$ and the length of the green line
    represents $\bigtriangleup y$. Slope is given by $\frac{\bigtriangleup
    y}{\bigtriangleup x}$.

    To check your answer enter the slope in the box as `slope=1`(if the slope is 1)

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.ticker import MultipleLocator

    x = np.linspace(0, 10)
    y = 3*x  # choosing '3' as the slope

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(x, y)

    ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(MultipleLocator(2))
    ax.xaxis.set_minor_locator(MultipleLocator(1))
    ax.yaxis.set_major_locator(MultipleLocator(2))
    ax.yaxis.set_minor_locator(MultipleLocator(1))

    plt.grid(b=True, which='major', color='k', linestyle='-', lw=0.2)
    plt.grid(b=True, which='minor', color='k', linestyle='--', lw=0.2)

    # plotting the line
    plt.plot(x, y, color='r')

    # plotting the line parallel to x-axis
    plt.plot(np.linspace(2, 6, 100), 6*np.ones(100))
    # plotting the line parallel to y-axis
    plt.plot(6*np.ones(100), np.linspace(6, 18, 100))

    # highlighting the points of intersection
    plt.scatter([2, 6], [6, 18])
