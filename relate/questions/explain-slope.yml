    # Introduction to the slope of a line - I

    Using the graph paper sketches below calculate the slope. The length of the
    orange line represents $\bigtriangleup x$ and the length of the green line
    represents $\bigtriangleup y$. Slope is given by $\frac{\bigtriangleup
    y}{\bigtriangleup x}$.

    To check your answer enter the slope in the box as `slope=1`(if the slope is 1)
