## Open Questions

* Strength of motivation? Maybe "lovely" is enough
* Sources of "real-world" data for differencing?
* Getting to slopes
* How much code do they need to learn?
    * Three skills
        * Differencing / slopes
        * Summing / integrating
        * Plotting

## Action Items

* Activity between triangular and differencing:
    * Given part of a quadratic, continue table based on keeping second difference constant
* Change example to be continuous time
* Ping Lenny?
